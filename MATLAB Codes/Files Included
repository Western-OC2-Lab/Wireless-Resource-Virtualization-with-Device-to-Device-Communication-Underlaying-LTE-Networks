The simulation was developed using MATLAB using the following files:
-	main_file.m: Main file that calls the different files within the simulation.
-	initialization.m: It creates all the matrices and vectors and sets up the simulation environment.
-	channel_conditions.m: Generates the channel conditions using macroscopic and microscopic path loss components.   
-	BIP_CU.m: Determines the bip problem solution for LTE cellular users.  
-	BIP_D2D.m: Determines the bip problem solution for D2D users.
-	bip1.m: Function that solves the bip problem.
-	min_SNR_finder.m: Finds the minimum SNR for the corresponding modulation and coding scheme after the resource blocks are allocated.
-	specteff_finder.m: Finds the effective spectrum SNR. 
-	Heuristic_CU.m: Determines the heuristic solution using a greedy methodology for LTE cellular users.  
-	Heuristic_D2D.m: Determines the heuristic solution using a greedy methodology for D2D users.
-	Results_aggregation_iteration.m; Aggregates the achieved results in each iteration.
-	Results_aggregation_mu_value.m: Averages the results for the different iterations for one mu value.
-	Results_plotting.m: Plots the results.
